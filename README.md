## Overview
In previous weeks, we used labelled images to perform supervised learning to classify sea ice and lead through Convolutional Neural Network, Random Forest and Vision Transformer. This week, we will adopt another approach: unsupervised learning. Unlike supervised learning, this approach does not require labelled datasets to learn; instead, it will discover structures or patterns in the data without prior instruction. In this project, we will first introduce the K-mean Clustering Algorithm and Gaussian Mixture Models. Then, use these two classification methods on images from Sentinel-2 and altimetry data from Sentinel-3 to classify sea ice and lead. Lastly, the results will be compared with the classification by ESA.
